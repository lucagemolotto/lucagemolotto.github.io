[EMRA](https://emra-25.marinerobotics.eu/) is a workshop on Marine Robotics and its applications, where researches, industry, users and stakeholders meet. I was invited to talk about and represent the "Chemico-Physical and Multispectral Data Fusion via Autonomous Vessel -- Brigantine" project. Brigantine is about fusing chemico-physical data, gathered by classic CTD sensor arrays with multispectral data taken by specialized photo cameras.
