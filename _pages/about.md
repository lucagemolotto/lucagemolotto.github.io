I am a pre-doc Research Fellow at the University of Udine, Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics.

I've studied for both my BSc and MSc at the University of Udine, where during my MSc I followed the Concurrent and Distributed Languages and Systems track, with a focus on formal methods and verification.

Currently, I work for the [Brigantine](https://www.italy-croatia.eu/web/brigantine) project, which is part of the greater Interreg IT-HR cooperation programme. My involvement is in the software side, developing the data gathering layer of our autonomous catamaran but I have also a fairly hands-on approach with every aspect of the catamaran, from the engineering side to its use by the marine biologists involved.

My main interests lie in Cyber-Physical and Distributed Systems, especially the development and application of formal methods in relation to them.
I'm currently working on a system for choreographic coordination of smart devices, in particular, swarms of drones.
