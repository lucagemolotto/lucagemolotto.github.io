I am pre-doc Research Fellow at the University of Udine, Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics.

I work on the [Brigantine](https://www.italy-croatia.eu/web/brigantine) project, which is part of the greater Interreg IT-HR cooperation programme. My involvement is in the software side, developing the data gathering layer of our autonomous catamaran but I have also a fairly hands-on approach with every aspect of the catamaran, from the engineering side to its use by the marine biologists.

My main interests lie in Cyber-Physical and Distributed Systems, especially the development and application of formal methods in relation to them.
